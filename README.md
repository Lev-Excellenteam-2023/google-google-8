# Google auto-complete project

Implement autocomplete system.
The program receives input from user and generates options for completion.

## Algorithms & Structures

The dataset is saved twice:
- Dictionary: Keys are a unique sentence id and values are the sentences themselves and their source.
- Trie: Each word in the dataset is saved in the trie. 
Every node has a dictionary. Keys are ids of sentences where the word appears and values are the positions in the sentence in which it appears.



## Detailed Code Flow

*Start by detailing how you've set up your main data structures. E.g., "We begin by collecting fruit prices from various sources." Then, explain the core logic or algorithm. E.g., "Next, we apply the Example Algorithm to identify price spikes." Conclude with any post-processing or output generation. E.g., "Finally, we visualize the price trends on a graph."*

**Hint**: This section is just a placeholder example of fruit prices. Replace it with a clear and detailed flow of your actual project's logic, algorithms, and processes.
